The Obama/Biden image is an effective blend but quite disturbing because of the lack of alignment.
For the Obama/Biden hybrid image, the effect is very diminished by the lack of alignment.
I understand the alignment was produced by your "going further" face detection program
but I would have preferred seeing some manually aligned images. With that said, the code
for blending certainly seems correct and your explanations for the questions are broadly
aligned with what I'm looking for.
